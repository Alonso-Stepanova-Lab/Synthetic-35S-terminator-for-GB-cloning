# Synthetic-35S-terminator-for-GB-cloning
This perl script generates semi-random synthetic 35S terminator that are domesticated for cloning in the GoldenBraid System. The generated sequences maintain the same number nucleotide rations than the original 35S terminator but avoids the generation of potential GC and GNC methylation sequences. In addition, the sequence and position of several potential important sequences are preserved.
